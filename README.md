# Predicting Malnutrition in Children Using CNN Architectures 
This project aims to apply deep learning and address the issue of malnutrition in such places where resources are limited. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and its following architectures—VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet18—were trained on a dataset of labelled images to classify images into ‘healthy’ and ‘malnourished’ and automates classification of malnourished and healthy individuals. 

#Objectives
1. To conduct a comprehensive review on background, obstacles, and necessities associated with detecting malnutrition in children through image analysis.
2. To preprocess the dataset of images and standardize them for easy submission.
3. To leverage use of various CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet-18 for deep learning based classification.
4. To train the architectures on labelled data and customise layers accordingly to experiment.
5. To conduct experimentation of above models and compare metrics such as performance, accuracy, detection rate, etc. of each individual model and determine which aligns best with the given dataset.
